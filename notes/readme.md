# Marketplace Project - Technical Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the technical plan for the development of a marketplace project. The goal is to turn the business requirements into a structured technical blueprint, focusing on system architecture, API design, and workflow specification.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface for browsing products and managing user accounts.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the interface is responsive for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Essential Pages**: Develop the following pages:
  - Home
  - Product Listings
  - Product Details
  - Cart
  - Checkout
  - Order Confirmation

### Backend Requirements (with Sanity CMS)
- **Sanity CMS Setup**: Set up Sanity CMS as the backend to manage product data, customer details, and orders.
- **Schemas**: Create schemas in Sanity CMS to represent marketplace data (e.g., products, orders, customers).

### Third-Party API Integrations
- **Shipment Tracking**: Integrate shipment tracking APIs to track product deliveries.
- **Payment Gateway**: Implement a payment gateway API for handling transactions securely.

## System Architecture

### Architecture Diagram
Create a system architecture diagram that shows how the different components (frontend, backend with Sanity, third-party APIs) will communicate.

**Example Architecture**:
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Communicates with Sanity CMS to fetch product data.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Handle shipment tracking.
- **Payment Gateway**: Processes transactions.

### Workflows
- **User Registration**: When a user registers, their data is stored in Sanity CMS.
- **Product Browsing**: The frontend fetches product data from Sanity CMS.
- **Order Placement**: When a user places an order, the order data is stored in Sanity CMS.
- **Shipment Tracking**: Track shipments via a third-party API.

---

## API Requirements

### API Endpoints
Define the necessary API endpoints based on your system architecture.

**API Endpoint Examples**:
- **Product Endpoint (GET /products)**: Retrieve a list of products from Sanity CMS.
- **Order Endpoint (POST /orders)**: Create a new order in Sanity CMS.
- **Shipment Endpoint (GET /shipment)**: Get the shipment status from a third-party API.

### API Specifications

**Product Endpoint Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 100
}

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, API documentation, workflows, Sanity CMS schemas, and collaboration processes. Itâ€™s ready to be shared with your team and used as a reference throughout the hackathon.
