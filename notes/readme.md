## 1. System Architecture Overview

The system architecture for the General eCommerce marketplace consists of three main components: **Frontend**, **Backend (Sanity CMS)**, and **Third-Party APIs**. Below is a high-level diagram illustrating their interaction:

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
|     Frontend      |<----->|   Sanity CMS      |<----->|  Third-Party APIs |
| (Next.js)         | HTTP  | (Backend)         | HTTP  | (Payment, Shipping)|
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
```

### Key Components:
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Handles user interactions and displays product data, cart details, and order information.
- **Sanity CMS**: Manages product data, customer details, and order records. Acts as the backend database.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Integrates payment gateways (e.g., Stripe) and shipment tracking services.

### Data Flow:
1. **Product Browsing**: 
   - User visits the marketplace and browses products.
   - Frontend fetches product data from Sanity CMS via API.
2. **Cart Management**:
   - User adds products to the cart.
   - Cart data is stored temporarily in the frontend or Sanity CMS.
3. **Order Placement**:
   - User proceeds to checkout.
   - Frontend sends order details to Sanity CMS for storage.
   - Payment is processed via a third-party payment gateway.
4. **Shipment Tracking**:
   - Order status and shipment details are fetched from a third-party API and displayed to the user.

## 2. Key Workflows

### 1. Product Browsing
1. User visits the marketplace homepage.
2. Frontend requests product data from Sanity CMS via `GET /products`.
3. Sanity CMS returns product details (name, price, description, image).
4. Frontend displays the products in a user-friendly interface.

### 2. Cart Management
1. User adds a product to the cart.
2. Frontend updates the cart state and sends a `POST /cart` request to Sanity CMS.
3. Sanity CMS stores the cart data and returns a confirmation.

### 3. Order Placement
1. User proceeds to checkout.
2. Frontend sends a `POST /orders` request to Sanity CMS with order details (customer info, products, total amount).
3. Payment is processed via a third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).
4. Sanity CMS records the order and sends a confirmation to the user.

### 4. Shipment Tracking
1. User views their order history via `GET /orders`.
2. Frontend fetches shipment tracking details from a third-party API.
3. Shipment status is displayed to the user in real-time.

## 3. API Endpoints

### 1. `GET /products`
- **Purpose**: Fetch all available products.
- **Response**:

  {
    "products": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Product A",
        "price": 100,
        "description": "A sample product.",
        "image": "https://example.com/productA.jpg"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 2. `POST /cart`
- **Purpose**: Add a product to the cart.
- **Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "productId": 1,
    "quantity": 2
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Product added to cart.",
    "cartId": "12345"
  }
  ```

### 3. `POST /orders`
- **Purpose**: Create a new order.
- **Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "customerId": 101,
    "products": [
      {"id": 1, "quantity": 2}
    ],
    "total": 200
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Order placed successfully.",
    "orderId": "67890"
  }
  ```

### 4. `GET /shipment`

## 4. Sanity CMS Schema Examples

### Product Schema
```javascript
export default {
  name: 'product',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    { name: 'name', type: 'string', title: 'Product Name' },
    { name: 'price', type: 'number', title: 'Price' },
    { name: 'description', type: 'text', title: 'Description' },
    { name: 'image', type: 'image', title: 'Product Image' },
    { name: 'stock', type: 'number', title: 'Stock Level' }
  ]
};
```

## 5. Collaboration and Refinement

### Collaboration Tools:
- **Slack/Discord**: For team discussions and brainstorming.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaborative document editing.
- **Google Meet**: For virtual meetings and feedback sessions.

### Refinement Process:
1. Share your technical plan with teammates for feedback.
2. Use GitHub to track changes and improvements.
3. Incorporate feedback to refine system architecture, workflows, and API documentation.
